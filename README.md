What I've learnt so far:
  
  - The importance of solving problems or using a certain approach such as generics early on before it starts to become more and more complicated to change.
  
  - The importance of adding features or using principles in specific order to add more structure to the process of creating the program
  
  - Experience in creating larger scale programmes
  
  - Further experience with GUIs and Object Oriented Programming
  
  - Further Experience in writing tests and analysing code coverage
  
  
  
  Planned Features:
  
    - Network-based gameplay (Multiplayer)
    - Cross-platform clients (Java Client & Web client)
    - Single player mode against bots of varying difficulty
